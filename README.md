### The mechanics of the game
The game is played with a 'Spanish baraja'.

From the Spanish playing cards entry of wikipedia:

"The traditional Spanish baraja is an old deck that was brought over by the Moors to Spain during the 14th century. The cards are still called naipes after the nā'ib cards found in the Mamluk deck...

Smaller decks have 40 cards and lack ranks 8, 9 and comodines (jokers). The four suits are bastos (clubs), oros (literally "golds", that is, golden coins), copas (cups), and espadas (swords). The four suits are thought to represent the four social classes of the Middle Ages. The suit of coins represents the merchants, the clubs represents the peasants, the cups represent the church and the swords represent the military.

The three face cards of each suit have pictures similar to the jack, queen, and king in the French deck, and rank identically. They are the sota, which is similar to the jack/knave and generally depicts a page or squire, the caballo (knight, literally "horse"), and the rey (king) respectively."

At each round of play the player places a bet. After that, the player and the dealer each draw one card from the deck.The player is then repeatedly asked if another card is wanted. The player can continue to draw cards while the total is less than 7½. After the player's turn is over, the dealer's cards are shown. The dealer's play is always the same: the dealer continues to draw cards only if the total is less than 5½. The value of every card doesn't always agree with the rank of the card. The values are listed in the following table:

Name:	As	Dos	Tres	Cuatro	Cinco	Seis	Siete	Sota	Caballo	Rey
Rank:	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	10	11	12
Values:	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	½	½	½
For this assignment, assume the player starts with 100 pesos (or dollars) and the game ends when the player is down to 0, or when the dealer loses 900. Also, it is a good idea to add input validation and prevent the user from betting an amount bigger than the one the player actually has.
